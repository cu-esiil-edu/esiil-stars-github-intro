# Update the ESIIL Course Syllabus With Your Profile

#### In this assignment you will: 
* **Fork** a `GitHub` repository
* Make changes to a forked `GitHub` repository
* Create a **Pull Request** in `GitHub`

For this next assignment, you're going to **fork** an existing GitHub repository (repo), make changes to your forked repo, and create a 
**Pull Request** to add your changes to the original repo. Forking is one approach that allows you to contribute to a project by making changes to a **local version** of a file, and then sharing those suggested changes with whoever maintains the project you're working on.

Here you will be adding your profile information (Name, photo, email, website) to the course syllabus. To do this you will need to complete the following:

## Step 0: Fork the course syllabus repo
#### Get started by forking the course syllabus repository to your GitHub account 
* Navigate to the course syllabus repo: <a href="https://github.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-syllabus-2023" target="_blank">**https://github.com/cu-esiil-edu/esiil-stars-syllabus-2023**</a>
* **Fork** this repository to your your GitHub account
  * Select the drop down arrow from the **Fork** tab in the upper right menu
  * Select **`+ Create a new fork`**
  * Select the green **`Create fork`** button at the bottom of the page


## Step 1: Edit the `index.md` file 
#### In your forked repository 
* Open the `index.md` file
* Find the section for your school
  * Add your name (as a _**header**_), professional headshot, links to your email, and website
  * Use the same formatting from the **Meet our Team** section above
  * Don't forget to **Commit changes**!


## Step 2: Add your changes using a Pull Request
* Select the **Pull requests** tab from the menu at the top of the page
* Select the green **`New pull request`** button
* Select the green **`Create pull request`** button
* Include a description of the changes you're making and select the green **`Create pull request`** button one more time
